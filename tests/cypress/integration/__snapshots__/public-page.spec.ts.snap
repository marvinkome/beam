      <p>
        We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons

      <p><strong>6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>In Short:</em></strong
        >&nbsp;&nbsp;<em
          >If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social
          media account, we may have access to certain information about
          you.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Services offers you the ability to register and login using your
        third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter
        logins).
      </p>
      <p>
        Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information
        about you from your social media provider. The profile Information we
        receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but
        will often include your name, email address, friends list, profile
        picture as well as other information you choose to make public on such
        social media platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
        described in this privacy notice&nbsp;or that are otherwise made clear
        to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and
        are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
        third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their
        privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your
        personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on
        their sites and apps.
      </p>
      <p><strong>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>In Short:</em></strong
        >&nbsp;&nbsp;<em
          >We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the
          purposes outlined in this privacy notice&nbsp;unless otherwise
          required by law.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
        of time in which users have an account with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>
      <p><strong>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>
      <p>

        >&nbsp;&nbsp;<em
          >We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
          organizational and technical security measures.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
        measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
        process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
        information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
        storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
        promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
        third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly
        collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do
        our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
        information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should
        only access the Services within a secure environment.

        service-related emails that are necessary for the administration and use
        of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other
        non-marketing purposes. To otherwise opt-out, you may: contact us at

      <p><strong>10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

      <p>Verification process</p>
      <p>
        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
        determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
        our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
        information so that we can match it with the information you have
        previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request
        you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can
        match the information you provide with the information we already have
        on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g.
        phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use
        other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
        your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible,
        we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the
        purposes of verification. If, however, if we cannot verify your identity
        from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you
        provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your
        identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete
        such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
        you.
